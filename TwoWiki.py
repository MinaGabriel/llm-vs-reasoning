# TwoWiki.py: the 2WikiMultihopQA dataset in the shared schema, like MuSiQue.py and HotpotQA.py.
#   Shared schema: id, dataset, question, answer, gold_answers, hops, decomposition, paragraphs, source
# Only "compositional" and "inference" questions are kept: chains such as "Who is the mother of the director
# of film X?". "comparison" and "bridge_comparison" questions need comparing values or yes/no, which NARS
# cannot do here, so they are set aside as a NARS limitation, like in HotpotQA.
# Usage: python pipeline.py --dataset TwoWiki --per-hop 150   ->  runs/2Wiki_test.pkl
