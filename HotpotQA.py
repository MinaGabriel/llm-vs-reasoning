# HotpotQA.py: the HotpotQA dataset (distractor setting) in the shared schema, like MuSiQue.py.
#   Shared schema: id, dataset, question, answer, gold_answers, hops, decomposition, paragraphs, source
# Only "bridge" questions are kept: a 2-hop chain through one entity (like MuSiQue's 2-hop questions).
# "comparison" questions ("Who was born first, X or Y?", yes/no) need comparing values, which NARS
# cannot do here, so they are set aside as a NARS limitation, like the how/why questions in MuSiQue.
